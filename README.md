supplementary-reader is a simple text reading tool for Linux users who read slowly or have dyslexia. It can use either OCR (image to text) on a section of the screen, or it can use text selection. 


# Install #

one option is:

```
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/supplementary-reader https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForrestHilton/supplementary-reader/main/supplementary-reader 

sudo pacman -Syu xclip espeak-ng gnome-screenshot tesseract tesseract-data-eng bash 
```

# Usage #
here are the three usages: 

```
supplementary-reader speak selection [speed]
supplementary-reader speak screenshot [speed]
supplementary-reader stop
```
speed is in words per minute and defaults to 150

# Dependency's #

* xorg (sort of)
* xclip
* espeak-ng (in the current version)
* gnome-screenshot (gnome is not required)
* tesseract
* bash

# Recommended Shortcuts #

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONFIGURING SHORTCUTS on your operating system; however on kde, you can import `shortcuts.khotkeys` in shortcut settings. These are my recommendations:

| shortcut             | command                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ctrl-Alt-Shift-S     | supplementary-reader speak screenshot 150     |
| Ctrl-Alt-S           | supplementary-reader speak selection 150      |
| Ctrl-Alt-Shift-F     | supplementary-reader speak screenshot 225     |
| Ctrl-Alt-F           | supplementary-reader speak selection 225      |
| Ctrl-Alt-Shift-D     | supplementary-reader stop                     |
| Ctrl-Alt-D           | supplementary-reader stop                     |

# Contributing #

Even bad contributions are welcome. Especially feel free to add optional or alternative dependencies. This is a really small script, so don't even worry about backwards compatibility. With that said I don't guarantee that I will merge anything. 

If you get speech dispatcher to work consistently, you can completely replace the espeak dependency.

# TODO #

Although the current configuration works for me, I would like to make this functionality available to a larger audience.
* rewrite it in a different language?
* incorporate this into a larger project?
* use speech dispatcher?
* hack together some kind of highlighting?
